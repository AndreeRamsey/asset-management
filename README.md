# Asset Management

A repository for Asset Management for OOI data.

## Workflow

The current system requires a very specific workflow due to the way in which asset data is integrated into the system. Here are a few key points:

NOTE:  As per Tickets #9466 #9468, when files of the form 
    ._* 	or 
    ._*.csv   or
    .DS_
are included in requests to update this repository, these "hidden" files are to be ignored. 


### Bulk Load - Asset Records

* When loading asset records (*-AssetRecord.csv)
  * Whole sheet ingest. Loading the bulk load sheet requires dropping all the assets from the system and reloading. Otherwise, duplicate asset records will be made.
  * Modifications. It is possible to add additions assets (not in the original sheet) by creating new -AssetRecord sheets. This can be done without dropping the asset database, but will require restarting the UI.
  * These data must be loaded before any dependent data (integration events or deployment events) can be loaded.

### Integration Events

* Integration Events (*-IntegrationEvents.csv)
  * For RSN data, these are autogenerated from the source deployment sheets (must be done in google sheets due to formula limitations).

### Deployment/Calibration Events

* Deployment Events (Omaha_Cal_Info-*.xlsx)
  * These are the last sheets that should be uploaded.
  * For RSN, there is a single sheet that is loaded for all deployments and calibration. 
    * This was done at the request of the MIO so they can track the changes between deployments.
    * Also note that redeployment is on a per instrument basis for RSN, not per mooring like on the uncabled assets.
